# reading-strategies-impact
This <a href="https://hchoi0309.github.io/reading-strategies-impact/index.html">project</a> aims to investigate the impact of different reading strategies — highlighting, underlining, and reading without annotations — on reading comprehension. Using a within-subjects experimental design, participants engage with standardized reading passages and complete comprehension tests under each condition. The study also explores the relationship between the amount of text highlighted/underlined and comprehension scores.
